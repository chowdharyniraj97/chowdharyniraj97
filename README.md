Hey! I am Niraj, a CS graduate student at the University of Florida. I am an aspiring software engineer/web developer who enjoys simplifying other's tasks by leveraging the power of technology and building tools that cuts down the user's time. A short example would be how I helped my mother and a friend recently - When my mother whined about being tired of attending calls for her consultancy, I built her a website. When my friend cribbed about him being disorganized, I built him a Todo App. Seeing others being grateful to you for demystifying their task, is a unique feeling that only a developer can understand and enjoy. | ![github stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=chowdharyniraj97&show_icons=true&line_height=30) <p align="center">27182818284590452353602874713526624977572470937</p>
